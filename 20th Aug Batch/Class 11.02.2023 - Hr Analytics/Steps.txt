First Worksheet (Key Performence Indicatore - KPI) -

* Employee and attrition count

	> We need the employee count first
	> Take employee count and put this up in the text box in the marks section ,  (Aggregation SUM)
	> Now we need the attrition count , as we can see that the attrition column is present with 'yes/no' inputs inside
	> So we will create a calculated field here naming - "Attrition Count"
	> Formula for attrition calculated field - IF [Attrition] = 'Yes' THEN 1 ELSE 0 END
	> Now we will simply double click on the attrition and it will reflect under the (SUM(employee count)) Section in Marks area
	> A new section called measure values will pop up in the marks area as well which will contain both employee count and attrition count values into
	  Consideration.
	> Measure Names filter will pop up in the filter and in the column section.
	> Let's put employee count before the attrition count section.
	> Let's also select entire view for our worksheet.

* Attrition Rate

	> We will create another calculated field now for finding "Attrition Rate"
	> The formula - SUM(Attrition Count)/SUM(Employee Count)
	> Now we will simply double click on newly created "Attrition Rate " column and it will reflect under the Marks section in 'Measure Values'Box.
	> The aggregation for the new column will be displayed 0 by default so we need to format the same.
	> Click on format and let's go to numbers in the pane section - Percentage - 2 Decimal Places.
	> Now a percentage will show in the attrition rate section.

* Active Employee

	> Create a calculated field named "Active employee"
	> The formula - SUM(Employee Count) - SUM(Attrition Count)
	> Now simply double click on the "Active employee column"
	> Place the new column after "Attrition rate" column.

* Average Employee Age
	
	> We will simply double click on the age column
	> By default it will display the sum of age , let's change the measure parameter and make it average.

* For all the section where data is shown without percentage we will go ahead in the format section and will create the number formatting defined as 0
  Decimal points
