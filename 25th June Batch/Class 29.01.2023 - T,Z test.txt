Confidence level - 0.95
evaluation of z score


Problem statement -

Complain filed that in xyz Municipal school the students are underfed.

let's send a team to evaluate - 

1st Approach - going to the school , asking the students ... ---- Not taking this one
Our approach - age - 10 , average weight - 32 - sample
population average weight - 35

Null Hypothesis - Complaint is Untrue - No significant weight differnece  between sample weight and population weight - p value is greater 
or equal to significance level 
Alternate Hypothesis - Complaint is True  - significant weight differnece  between sample weight and population weight - p value is lesser 
to significance level .


T Test 

Inependent Variable
Dependent Variable

Marks in maths - Independent Variable
Marks in Physics - Dependent Variable

Critical Value - 2.10 at 0.05 level of significance , 2.10 at 0.95 level of confidence 
                 2.88 at 0.01 level of significance , 2.88 at 0.99 level of confidence 

if calulated t is lesser than critical accept null Hypothesis
if calulated t is greater than critical reject null Hypothesis
